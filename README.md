In this repo there are solutions of some puzzles on this platform written in C++ language. Hope you can find these solutions clean and nice. 

Bio: I signed up to CodinGame ~1.5 year ago. Since then I've been solving some coding puzzles aiming to improve my coding skills and learn something new. I also from time to time play Clash Of Code (CoC) with some other players from around the world. I strongly believe that communication and feedback helps improve the ability to write understandable and readable code.
